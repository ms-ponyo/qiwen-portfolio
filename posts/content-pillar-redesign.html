      <p>The publishing portal is mixed in the feed, which is not highly recognizable</p>
      <p>At the same time, the position moves out of the screen as the user slides the page</p>
      <p><strong>Design solution:</strong></p>

      <p>Improve screen efficiency ratio. More content is displayed in one screen, so users can read more information.</p>
      <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
      <p>The feed UI has been staying as the global style.</p>
      <p>Zephyr feed's design is not friendly to Chinese users..</p>
      <p><strong>Design Posts with photos</strong></p>
      <p>This is the most common type of posts on Zephyr. The design goal of the improvement is to:</p>
      <p>Display the full photo when there's only one</p>
      <p>Reduce the size of single photo (so that users can see more than one post one the screen)</p>
      <p>Simplify the layout for multiple photos (a by-product is that we saved lots of space thus other posts got more exposure)</p>
      <p><strong>50% ramp result</strong></p>
      <p>The data results are positive:</p>
      <p><strong>+4.11% Homepage PV</strong></p>
      <p><strong>+4.10% FUV</strong></p>
      <p><strong>+8.39% SU Revenue</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5.Feed font size and line spacing</strong></p>
      <p>We got some feedback from users that they felt our font size is small, and the content is crowded. So in order to solve these problems, we optimized font size and line spacing to make the feed more readable.</p>
      <p>Previous:</p>
      <p>The font size of the text, re-sharing and article title are all size 14, lacking hierarchy</p>
      <p>And the line spacing is 100%, which is crowded</p>
      <p><strong>Redesign</strong></p>
      <p>On the basis of keeping consistent with the design guideline of the whole App, adjusting the font size and line spacing to improved the reading experience.</p>
      <p>Font size: 16 points for the main text, 15 points for forwarding, the font size increases the primary and secondary layering of the reading experience;</p>
      <p>Line spacing: increased to 140%, improving reading comfort;</p>
      <p>Text transparency: 70% for text, comments, and forwarding; Card's title: 90%, highlighting the main content of the card through transparency;</p>
      <p><strong>Feedbacks from UER from 2020.9</strong></p>
