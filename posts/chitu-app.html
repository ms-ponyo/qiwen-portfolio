      <p>With the philosophy and pace of a startup company, I participated in the closed development, contributing to the entire app product creation and design process of Chitu from scratch. In less than a year, we created a professional social networking app that achieved a user base of 2 million in China.</p>

      <p>The redesign aimed to reduce unnecessary page elements and minimize reading distractions to enhance the reading experience while also improving the recognition of various content types within the dynamic Feed Pillar.</p>
      <p>Differentiated design was employed to enhance the recognizability of each content type, elevating the distinctiveness of content cards.</p>
      <p>The entire homepage’s design style was revamped, with adjustments to font size and spacing, and a shift towards a card-style, lightweight design as the main approach.</p>
      <p>The redesign focused on enhancing the reading experience by reducing unnecessary elements and minimizing wireframe-style design.</p>
      <p>While ensuring a quality reading experience, the redesign also aimed to lower the card height to increase page browsing rates.</p>
